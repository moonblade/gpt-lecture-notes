CREATE_NOTE_PROMPT = """
Using the provided lecture transcription, please create detailed and organized study notes. The notes should be structured in a markdown format for ease of reading and future reference. Follow these guidelines to ensure the notes capture all essential information effectively:

Title and Subtitles: Clearly define the main topic of the lecture at the beginning. Use subtitles to separate different sections or subtopics discussed in the lecture.

Bullet Points and Numbered Lists: Use bullet points to summarize key points, facts, or concepts. Numbered lists should be used for sequences, steps, or procedures that need to be followed in order.

Highlighting Important Concepts: Bold or italicize terms, definitions, and important concepts to make them stand out. This makes it easier to locate and review critical information.

Examples and Illustrations: Wherever the lecture includes examples or specific illustrations to explain concepts, include these in a clear and concise manner.

Summaries and Conclusions: At the end of each section, provide a brief summary or conclusion that encapsulates the main ideas or findings discussed.

Questions and Action Items: If the lecture poses any questions for contemplation or suggests action items, list these at the end of the notes for further study or exploration.

References and Further Reading: Include any references to textbooks, articles, or other materials mentioned in the lecture for additional study.

Visual Aids: If the lecture references any diagrams, charts, or other visual aids, describe these in the notes and note their significance or main points.

Your goal is to create a comprehensive, easy-to-navigate document that can be used for efficient study and review. The notes should be in clear language, summarizing the lecture while highlighting all the important points needed for future study.
